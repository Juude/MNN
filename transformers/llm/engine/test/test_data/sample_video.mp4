This is a placeholder for a small MP4 video file.
Replace this with a valid, short MP4 video for the video_test to function correctly.
This file needs to be openable by OpenCV's VideoCapture and provide a few frames.
Ideally, 2-3 frames, with a small resolution (e.g., 16x16 or 32x32).
The content of this text file will not make it a valid MP4.
It's here so that file system operations in the test can find it.
A real MP4 is required for the `omni->multimodeProcess("vid", ...)` call to succeed past the `cap.isOpened()` check and frame reading loop in `Omni::videoProcess`.
Without a real MP4, the `videoProcess` function will return an empty vector of IDs,
and most assertions in the test will fail (except perhaps not-empty if start/end tokens are added unconditionally, which they are not).
For the purpose of this subtask, the structure of the test and CMake integration is the primary goal.
The actual video content and thus successful processing by `videoProcess` is secondary for now.
This also means that `cv::VideoCapture cap; cap.open(file);` will likely fail in `Omni::videoProcess` with this placeholder.
The test will demonstrate the structure but likely fail its assertions until a real video is provided.
For now, the `videoProcess` will print "Omni Can't open video" and return an empty vector.
The test should handle this gracefully, or the assertions will fail.
Let's make the test expect an empty vector for now, given this placeholder.
This means the assertions for mVisionStart/End will also fail.
The goal is to set up the test *structure*.
The assertions will be written as if a real video was present, but they will be expected to fail with this placeholder.
No, it's better to make the test reflect the current reality with the placeholder.
If videoProcess returns empty on failure to open, the test should assert that.
Or, for the test to be more complete in structure, we'd mock Omni or parts of it.
Let's assume for the test structure that a *minimal* video *could* be opened.
The current `videoProcess` will print an error and return empty.
So, the test should assert that the returned vector is empty if the placeholder is used.
This is not ideal for testing the *logic* of `videoProcess` but tests the `multimodeProcess` path.
To properly test `videoProcess` logic, a real video or a mock of `cv::VideoCapture` would be needed.
The subtask asks to "Asserts that the returned `std::vector<int>` of token IDs is not empty." - this implies a successful processing.
This placeholder will make that assertion fail. This is a known limitation for now.
I will proceed with creating this placeholder.
